This is an exercise that i performed while in Data Analytics boot camp. I ran several different analyses on a large set of video game user data using pandas in python. Data was based on fact information and purchasing history of players in a fabricated massive multiplayer role-playing game (MMORPG).

I utilized pandas in Jupyter Notebook to run several different analyses of purchasing patterns within the game such as purchase history based on age and gender demographics, as well as identifying top items purchased and which players spent the most money. The data was taken from a csv file.
